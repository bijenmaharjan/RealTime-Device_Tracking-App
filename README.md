# RealTime-Device_Tracking-App
The Real-Time Device Tracking App enables multiple users to track each other's live locations on a map in real-time. Using Socket.IO for real-time communication and Leaflet.js for interactive maps, users can visualize the location of others, calculate distances between users, and see real-time updates.
